# Engine/Core SDK

`JA2::EngineCore` is the campaign- and platform-independent C++17 engine
surface. It can be installed without SDL, SGP, VFS, game data, or any JA2
application library and consumed from an unrelated CMake project.

## Install

Build the repository normally, then install only the SDK component:

```sh
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/ja2-engine-sdk --component EngineSDK
```

The SDK currently uses its own `0.1.x` compatibility line while the engine API
is being extracted. Installed packages provide headers under `Engine/Core`, the
static Core library, and CMake package metadata.

## Consume

```cmake
find_package(JA2Engine 0.1 CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_host PRIVATE JA2::EngineCore)
```

Windows consumers must use the same static MSVC runtime ABI as the installed
archive. The package exports the exact CMake value for that purpose:

```cmake
if(MSVC OR CMAKE_CXX_SIMULATE_ID STREQUAL "MSVC")
  set_property(TARGET your_host PROPERTY
    MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "${JA2Engine_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY}")
endif()
```

Configure the consumer with either `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` pointing at the install
prefix or `JA2Engine_DIR` pointing at its `lib/cmake/JA2Engine` directory.

`EngineHost` is the smallest reusable composition root: service contracts,
packages and capabilities, versioned persistence, assets, state control, and
lifecycle without any game command vocabulary. The generic `CommandStream`,
queue, processor, and journal building blocks are also public. The repository's
`Engine/Adapters/JA2` target layers `EngineRuntime`, tactical commands, their
codec, and durable replay on Core, but those game-specific types are not part
of the pure EngineSDK component. Platform adapters and legacy game types remain
outside the SDK boundary.

The `engine_sdk_consumer` CTest installs the component and builds a fresh
external project against `find_package(JA2Engine)`. This is the compatibility
gate for missing headers, leaked source-tree includes, and unpublished symbols.

Optional source-built host services are discovered through `ServiceCatalog`
using portable IDs and major/minor contracts. Registrations are non-owning and
must outlive the host. The catalog seals when initialization or package
bootstrap begins, so packages may safely retain a successfully resolved service
for the runtime session. This is not yet a stable native plugin ABI.

Hosts may also populate `RuntimeConfiguration` with portable keys and boolean,
signed integer, double, or string values before initialization. Packages read
the sealed configuration from their bootstrap/runtime context. Replacing a key
with a different type is rejected so configuration contracts cannot silently
change beneath consumers.

Each package callback also receives `PackageStorage`, a view bound to that
package's ID. Record names are portable identifiers and data uses the engine's
bounded checksummed envelope format under `PackageData/<package>/<record>.bin`.
This is the preferred durable-state API for new packages.

Use `PackageBootstrapContext::messagePublisher` for outbound package messages.
It binds the source to the registered package ID and accepts only a portable
topic plus the bounded byte payload. The raw message bus remains available
during the compatibility window for established integrations.

Declare mandatory host integrations in `PackageDescriptor::requiredServices`.
IDs must be unique portable identifiers and minimum major versions must be
non-zero. The engine checks all active packages against the sealed service
catalog before configuration starts, so a missing or incompatible integration
fails deterministically before package code acquires partial resources.
